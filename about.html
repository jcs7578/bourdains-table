      <h2 class="about-heading">What Is This?</h2>
      <p>
        Eat Like Anthony is an interactive map of every restaurant, street stall, market, and hole-in-the-wall
        that Anthony Bourdain visited across his four television shows. It's a tribute to the man who showed
        us that the best meals are rarely found in the fanciest places — and that food is the most direct
        route into a culture's heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dataset includes <strong>133 locations</strong> across <strong>46 countries</strong>, from Katz's Deli
        in Manhattan to a longhouse in the Borneo jungle. Each entry includes what he ate, which show featured it,
        and what made the visit memorable.

    <!-- The Shows -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2 class="about-heading">The Shows</h2>

      <div class="show-card show-ct-card">
        <h3 class="show-card-title">A Cook's Tour</h3>
        <p class="show-card-meta">Food Network &middot; 2002&ndash;2003 &middot; 2 Seasons, 35 Episodes</p>
        <p>
          Where it all began. Fresh off the success of <em>Kitchen Confidential</em>, Bourdain set out to eat
          the world. From the back alleys of Vietnam to the markets of Tokyo, this show established the blueprint:
          no scripts, no pretension, just a curious chef with a plane ticket and an empty stomach. Vietnam changed
          him forever — he said he fell in love with the country on this trip and never recovered.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="show-card show-nr-card">
        <h3 class="show-card-title">No Reservations</h3>
        <p class="show-card-meta">Travel Channel &middot; 2005&ndash;2012 &middot; 9 Seasons, 142 Episodes</p>
        <p>
          The show that made Bourdain a household name. Sharper, more ambitious, and unafraid to go dark when the
          story demanded it. The Beirut episode — interrupted by the 2006 war — became one of the most acclaimed
          hours of travel television ever made. No Reservations proved food television could be journalism, memoir,
          and adventure all at once.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="show-card show-lo-card">
        <h3 class="show-card-title">The Layover</h3>
        <p class="show-card-meta">Travel Channel &middot; 2011&ndash;2013 &middot; 2 Seasons, 20 Episodes</p>
        <p>
          A tighter format: what would Bourdain do with just 24&ndash;48 hours in a city? The Layover stripped away
          the narrative ambition and focused purely on eating and drinking — a rapid-fire guide to the essential
          spots. Hong Kong, Singapore, Montreal, Rome, Los Angeles — each episode was a masterclass in knowing
          exactly where to go and what to order.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="show-card show-pu-card">
        <h3 class="show-card-title">Parts Unknown</h3>
        <p class="show-card-meta">CNN &middot; 2013&ndash;2018 &middot; 12 Seasons, 96 Episodes</p>
        <p>
          The masterwork. Parts Unknown was less a food show than a document of the human condition, told through
          meals. Bourdain went to Iran, Congo, Myanmar, Libya, and the South Bronx. He dined with Obama in Hanoi
          on plastic stools. He showed us that sitting down to eat with someone is the most powerful thing you can
          do to understand them. Five Peabody Awards. The greatest travel show ever made.

    <!-- About Anthony Bourdain -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2 class="about-heading">Anthony Bourdain (1956&ndash;2018)</h2>
      <p>
        Anthony Michael Bourdain was an American chef, author, and television personality. He started as a line
        cook in New York City, eventually becoming executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles. His 2000 book
        <em>Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly</em> became a bestseller and launched
        his career as television's most compelling food storyteller.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over nearly two decades of television, Bourdain visited more than 80 countries. He championed street food
        vendors and hole-in-the-wall joints alongside Michelin-starred restaurants. He was an advocate for
        immigrant cooks, underrepresented cuisines, and the idea that the best way to understand a place is to
        sit down and eat with its people.

      <blockquote class="about-quote">
        "If I'm an advocate for anything, it's to move. As far as you can, as much as you can. Across the ocean,
        or simply across the river. Walk in someone else's shoes or at least eat their food."
